The electrostatics module can be used to solve the discretized material-dependent 
Poisson equation for electrostatic problems in two dimensions.

Introduction
------------

The classes form the following hierarchy:

**element**
  One grid point of the discretization. It can have many properties (potential, 
  charge, boundary condition, Fermi energy...). If you supply an element with 
  the discretization scheme (e.g. discretized version of the 2D Laplace 
  operator), it will tell you which other elements are the corresponding 
  neighbours. See the documentation :py:class:`.Element`.
**rectangle**
  a rectangular grid with m rows and n columns of elements, consisting of mxn 
  elements. It collects all matrix elements and boundary conditions from its 
  elements and creates the matrix and inhomogeneity. See the documentation 
  :py:class:`.Rectangle`.
**container**
  a container can contain one or several rectangles which are glued together 
  somehow. It's the only class that sees the "big picture". It can glue together
  two rectangles, or it can glue the left side of a rectangle together with the
  right side of the same rectangle, which creates periodic boundary conditions. 
  It collects the matrices and inhomogeneities from the contained rectangles and
  puts together an even bigger matrix. The container class also contains solving
  and plotting routines. See the documentation :py:class:`.Container` and 
  :py:class:`.PeriodicContainer`.

The normal procedure looks like this:

1. Create an operator/discretization scheme using 
   :py:class:`~.Laplacian2D2ndOrderWithMaterials` with a gridsize of 1 nm: 
   ``laplace=Laplacian2D2ndOrderWithMaterials(1e-9,1e-9)``
2. Create a :py:class:`~.Rectangle` with dielectric constant 1: 
   ``my_rectangle=rectangle(100,200,1.,laplace)``
3. Set the boundary conditions by setting properties of :py:class:`~.Element`: 
   ``my_rectangle[20,10].potential=10``
4. Create a :py:class:`~.Container` which contains the rectangles: 
   ``my_container=container((rectangle,))``
5. Create the matrix and inhomogeneity and invert the matrix using 
   :py:func:`Container.lu_solver <quantumcapacitance.electrostatics.Container.lu_solver>`: 
   ``solver,inhomogeneity=my_container.lu_solver()``
6. Solve system: ``solution=solver(inhomogeneity)``
7. Plot solution using 
   :py:func:`Container.vector_to_datamatrix <quantumcapacitance.electrostatics.Container.vector_to_datamatrix>`: 
   ``imshow(my_container.vector_to_datamatrix(solution)[0])``

If you want to go through different boundary conditions, you can create a new 
inhomogeneity and use the same solver, because the matrix and the inverted matrix 
stay the same:

8. Set the boundary conditions by setting properties of 
   :py:class:`~.Element`: ``my_rectangle[20,10].potential=5``
9. Create new inhomogeneity using 
   :py:func:`Container.createinhomogeneity <quantumcapacitance.electrostatics.Container.createinhomogeneity>`: 
   inhomogeneity = ``inhom=my_container.createinhomogeneity()``
10. Solve system: ``solution=solver(inhomogeneity)``
11. Plot solution using 
    :py:func:`Container.vector_to_datamatrix <quantumcapacitance.electrostatics.Container.vector_to_datamatrix>`: 
    ``imshow(my_container.vector_to_datamatrix(solution)[0])``

Repeat 8.-11. for all configurations. Of course, you can only reuse the solver 
if the matrix actually stays the same (e.g. different voltages on capacitor 
plates) , i.e. if you set the potential of an element which didn't have a fixed 
potential before, you also have to recalculate the matrix and the inverse 
(using lu_solver()).

Note: the area surrounding the rectangle always has the potential 0. If you want 
to set different potential boundary conditions, set the elements in your code.
Also note: the first coordinate (x) goes down, the second coordinate (y) goes 
right - the coordinate system is turned 90 degrees clockwise against the 
"standard" coordinate system.

The whole example, with meaningful boundary conditions::

  from quantumcapacitance.electrostatics import *
  
  height=100
  width=200
  laplace=Laplacian2D2ndOrderWithMaterials(1e-9,1e-9)
  dielectricity=1.
  my_rectangle=Rectangle(height,width,dielectricity,laplace)
  for x in range(height):
    my_rectangle[x,0].potential=1
    my_rectangle[x,width-1].potential=2
  for y in range(width):
    my_rectangle[0,y].potential=3
    my_rectangle[height-1,y].potential=4      
  my_container=Container((my_rectangle,))
  solver,inhomogeneity=my_container.lu_solver()
  solution=solver(inhomogeneity)
  imshow(my_container.vector_to_datamatrix(solution)[0])
  colorbar()
  
The output:

That's how it's done! 

How to set boundary conditions and other element properties
-----------------------------------------------------------

After creating a :py:class:`.Rectangle`, you can access its elements using the
``[]`` operator. Use ``i`` and ``j`` as row and column index::

  my_container[12,14].potential=10
  
You can set the following properties (also documented in the constructor of
:py:class:`.Rectangle`:

* **potential:** If potential is None, the element is a normal gridpoint.
  Otherwise, the element has a fixed potential (i.e. a metal/a capacitor).
* **charge:** charge of the element. Default is 0. If potential!=None, the charge value 
  will be ignored (metal is not charged).
* **epsilon:** Relative dielectrical constant.
* **neumannbc:** The slope along x or y direction can be fixed, e.g. for a neumann boundary condition.
  E.g. neumannbc=(14,'y') or neumannbc=(0,'x'). neumannbc and potential cannot be used
  at the same time. Charge has to be 0 (=default value).
  Values != 0 do not seem to work right (see comments).
             
Properties connected with quantum capacitance:

* **fermi_energy:** If the Fermi energy depends on the number of charge carriers, the fermi energy (=applied voltage e.g. by a battery)
  can be different from the electrostatic potential. fermi_energy_charge_dependence has to be defined in this case.
  Then you can calculate the quantum capacitance of the system.
  If fermi_energy_charge_dependence=None, then fermi_energy=potential.
         
* **fermi_energy_charge_dependence:** How the fermi energy of the material depends on the charge. Default is None.
  Mind that this setting assumes that the element is in a homogeneous environment.

Features of the container classes
---------------------------------

The container classes are responsible for

* connecting :py:class:`Rectangles <.Rectangle>`
* solving the system

At the moment, there are two classes:

* :py:class:`.Container`: glues several rectangles together. Use also if you
  only have one rectangle. 
* :py:class:`.PeriodicContainer`: glues together one side of the rectangle
  with the opposite side of the same rectangle, thus creating periodic boundary
  conditions.
  
Features of the container classes (besides gluing):

* :py:meth:`.PeriodicContainer.lu_solver`: the most important function of
  the container classes. It performs an LU decomposition and returns a solver
  function that can be applied to several inhomogeneities (=different boundary
  conditions).
* :py:meth:`.PeriodicContainer.simple_plot`: Create a simple plot of an
   existing solution for this system.
* :py:meth:`.PeriodicContainer.solve_and_plot`: Solve the system with the 
  current boundary conditions and plot.
* :py:meth:`.PeriodicContainer.vector_to_datamatrix`: Create a "picture matrix"
  of a given solution of the system (=a 2D representation of the solution
  vector). You can use this to export the solution (e.g. for interpolation) 
  or plot it using ``imshow()``.
* :py:meth:`.PeriodicContainer.apply_operator`: Apply an operator to a solution
  of the system and return the result.
* :py:meth:`.PeriodicContainer.charge`: Calculate the charge density for a 
  given solution.

Create lists of elements for your convenience
---------------------------------------------

The boundary conditions of your system will be given by an arrangement of
objects within the calculation area. Using lists, you can very conveniently
define those objects and then set the boundary conditions (also repeatedly)::

  #Set parameters
  height=100
  width=50
  dx=1e-9
  
  epsilon_SiO2=3.9
  sidegate_voltage=5
  backgate_voltages=numpy.arange(-5,5,0.5)
  
  #Create operator, rectangle and container
  lapl=Laplacian2D2ndOrderWithMaterials(dx,dx)
  my_rectangle=Rectangle(height,width,1.,lapl)
  my_container=Container((my_rectangle,))
  
  #Define the sections using lists. Later on, we never have to use
  #the explicit coordinates of the elements again.
  backgate=[my_rectangle[height-1,y] for y in range(width)]            #<<<
  sidegate=[my_rectangle[height/2,y] for y in range(width/2-5)]        #<<<
  topgate=[my_rectangle[height/2,y] for y in range(width/2,width)]     #<<<
  dielectric_medium=[my_rectangle[x,y] for x in range(height/2,height) #<<<
                                       for y in range(width)]          #<<<
  
  #Set the boundary conditions
  
  for element in sidegate:                                             #<<<
      element.potential=sidegate_voltage                               #<<<
      
  for element in dielectric_medium:                                    #<<<
      element.epsilon=epsilon_SiO2                                     #<<<
      
  #Although you will change that value later, you have to set it before
  #you calculate the LU decomposition so that the element knows that it
  #has a Dirichlet boundary condition.
  for element in backgate:
      element.potential=0
      
  #Solve system.
  solve,inhom=my_container.lu_solver()
      
  result_charges=[]
      
  #Loop over backgate voltage
  for backgate_voltage in backgate_voltages:
      for element in backgate:                                         #<<<
          element.potential=backgate_voltage                           #<<<
          
      #Solve system for this boundary condition.
      inhom=my_container.create_inhomogeneity()
      solution=solve(inhom)
       
      #Now, do something with the solution. We will save the charge
      #of the back- and topgate to a list.
      topgate_charge=my_container.charge(solution,lapl,sidegate)       #<<<
      backgate_charge=my_container.charge(solution,lapl,backgate)      #<<<
      
      result_charges.append((topgate_charge,backgate_charge))
      
  #...plot or export data...
