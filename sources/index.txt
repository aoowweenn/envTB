Welcome to EnvTB's documentation!
=================================

envTB is a Python package for **env** ironment-dependent **T** ight-**B** inding. 
Its features include:

* Use Nth-nearest-neighbour approximation
* Use Wannier orbitals/parameters generated by `VASP <http://www.vasp.at/>`_ 
  and `wannier90 <http://wannier.org>`_
* Solve electrostatic problems using finite differences in 2D
* Calculate quantum capacitance from DOS or LDOS (using tight-binding)
* Apply magnetic field
* Calculate energy spectrum, bandstructures and density of states of crystal 
  cells and supercells (e.g. defects, quantum dots, nanoribbons)
* Mix parameters from different DFT calculations to increase accuracy (e.g. use 
  special parameters around a vacancy or at an edge)

A main advantage is that the package is easily **scriptable** (which lies in the 
nature of Python). This means that you don't need input files, because you 
define **all necessary parameters in a *.py file**, and you can easily **use and 
export any data** that occurs during the calculation, because the data is saved 
in local variables that you can plot, export and reuse.

Setup
-----

Get the software at https://github.com/zonksoft/envTB.

For requirements and setup, see 
`here <https://github.com/zonksoft/envTB/blob/master/README.md>`_.

To write your scripts and test your calculations, I strongly suggest to get
IPython and use the IPython web interface::

  ipython notebook --pylab=inline
