Installation
============

Prerequisites
-------------

You need to install the following (mandatory) packages:

* Python
* Numpy
* Scipy
* Sympy
* BLAS
* LAPACK
* Matplotlib

We also suggest the following (optional) packages:

* IPython
* OpenMPI (necessary for parallel calculations on several CPUs or computers)
* Pip
* Git
* mpi4py (also necessary for parallel calculations)

**Simple installation**

If you are using Ubuntu or Debian (or an other Debian-based distribution),
run on the command line::

  sudo apt-get install libblas-dev liblapack-dev python python-numpy python-scipy python-sympy python-matplotlib

For the optional packages, run::

  sudo apt-get install ipython ipython-notebook openmpi-bin openmpi-doc libopenmpi-dev git python-pip
  sudo pip install mpi4py

**Optimized installation**

To optimize the calculation speed, you need to manually install BLAS and
LAPACK and link Numpy appropriately. Popular packages for optimized
BLAS/LAPACK are Intel MKL (download, Python installation guide) and ATLAS
(download, Python installation guide).

After that, run the commands from *Simple installation* with omitted
``libblas-dev``, ``liblapack-dev`` and ``python-numpy``.

**Installation on a cluster**

All mandatory packages are standard packages and are probably already
installed (as well as the MPI related packages). The program will tell 
you at the first start if something is missing - please consult your 
cluster administrator.

Setup
-----

The git repository is located at https://github.com/zonksoft/envTB.
On the command line, change to a directory where you want to save the
envTB sources and run::

  wget https://github.com/zonksoft/envTB/archive/master.tar.gz
  tar xzvf master.tar.gz
  cd envTB-master
  sudo python setup.py install

If you don't have sudo rights, run::

  python setup.py install --user

instead of the last command.

If you change the code in the directory where you downloaded envTB,
you have to reissue the installation command.

If you don't want to install envTB, but rather just use it from the
directory where you downloaded it, add::

  export PYTHONPATH=/where/you/downloaded/envTB/envTB-master/envtb:$PYTHONPATH

to the ``.bashrc`` file in your home directory.
