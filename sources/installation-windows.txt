Installation (Windows)
======================

Download the Enthought Python Distribution (EPD) `here <https://www.enthought.com/products/epd_free.php>`_ 
(scroll down, click the "Download" button and choose the Windows version. Install it.

Download the envTB package `here <https://github.com/zonksoft/envTB/archive/master.zip>`_ and unpack it to a directory of your choice.

Now, you have to tell Python where to look for the package. Right-click on *Computer -> Properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables*. Click on one of the "New" buttons. Enter "PYTHONPATH" as variable name and the path were you extracted the envTB package (e.g. C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\envTB-master) as variable value.

You have to install sympy half-manually. Open a terminal (e.g. click *Start -> Run*, type "cmd" and press OK), type "enpkg sympy" and press Enter.

That's it!

Usage
-----

Whenever you want to use envTB, you can use one of the methods mentioned in the Linux/Usage section. Just start a terminal and type the command (e.g. "python myfile.py", "ipython" or "ipython notebook --pylab=inline" - I personally prefer the first for bigger calculations and the last one for development).

You can also start Python and IPython from the Start menu.

For convenient use, you can add a shortcut to your Desktop by right-clicking on it -> New -> Shortcut, then enter "ipython notebook --pylab=inline", which will open a browser window with an IPython session right away.
